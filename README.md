# ClockSynchronisation

Berkeleys algorithm for clock synchronisation is being used for 3 servers
## Steps to execute the code
1) First execute all other process except process 1 and excecute process 1 last
2) The syntax is ./Berkeley TotalNoOfProcesses ProcessNumber
3) Execute each process in seperate terminal window

Ex : For synchronisation of 3 processes
./Berkeley 3 3  (In Terminal 1)
./Berkeley 3 2  (In Terminal 2)
./Berkeley 3 1  (In Terminal 3 and has to be executed lastly)
